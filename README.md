This repository contains all of the homework assignments including the midterms and HW10 from HCI 574 taken from Iowa State University.
These assignments were all done by me (David Tang) and does not contain solutions from the class, with that being said, some code may be incorrect or missing.

For HW10, I have the webapp hosted on pythonanywhere. Please check it out at this site: https://dtang.pythonanywhere.com/
