    "- Ensure that VSCode is set to autosve your notebook! In _Settings_ search for autosave and set it to 1000 ms.\n",
    "- It's fine to create new python cells if you want to try something without changing the offcial cell but please ensure that at the end there's only one cell with your official answer to the question and (__very impotant!__) that that cell as been run/executed so we can see its output.

    "Sometimes you may get additional extra credits if we feel your solution is particularly clever, etc. \n",

    "##### Q2 [ +1 pt ] This *optional* problem is worth 1 point\n",

    "You can solve these optional points to learn more or make up of points you missed in earlier HW. Note however, that there's a cap on the total HW points, if you have more than 100% of HW points the end of the semester, it will be reduced to 100%\n",
