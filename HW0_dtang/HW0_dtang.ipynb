    "### Work through the problems\n",
    "- Answer the questions shown in the HW. Fix anything with ???. Answers to text questions should be given in a printed string, e.g.:  `print(\"This is the answer\")` or as a comment e.g. `# This is the answer`\n",
    "- Ensure that VSCode is set to autosve your notebook! In _Settings_ search for autosave and set it to 1000 ms.\n",
    "- It's fine to create new python cells if you want to try something without changing the offcial cell but please ensure that at the end there's only one cell with your official answer to the question and (__very impotant!__) that that cell as been run/executed so we can see its output. If you want to \"save\" your inofficial cell(s), make sure they are fully commented out!\n",

    "### Handing in the HW\n",
    "- Check that all other files the HW might have (screenshots, data files, etc.) are indeed in the correct HW folder.\n",
    "- Zip your HW folder folder (e.g. into HW1_ALemming.zip) and hand it into Canvas. On Windows use Right-click -> Send To - Compress Folder. Please don't use rar or any other exotic compressors!\n",
    "- Zip your HW folder and hand it into Gradescope\n",

    "### Points\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of points a problem is worth when solved properly is always shown inside brackets at the heading of the problem, e.g.\n",
    "##### Q1 [ 3.5 pts]  This problem is worth 3.5 points\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may get additional extra credits if we feel your solution is particularly clever, etc. \n",
    "Some problem are entirely __optional__, these will have a + in from of the points, e.g.\n",
    "##### Q2 [ +1 pt ] This *optional* problem is worth 1 point\n",
    "```\n",
    "'''\n",
    "# figure out something ...\n",
    "???\n",
    "'''\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional problems start and end with a line with `'''`, so its code is ignored. If you want to do this problem you must first delete this first and last line and then make its code work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can solve these optional points to learn more or make up of points you missed in earlier HW. Note however, that there's a cap on the total HW points, if you have more than 100% of HW points the end of the semester, it will be reduced to 100%\n",
